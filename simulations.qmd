## Data Generating Process

We carry out a simulation study for a Gaussian distribution, where we link the $\mu$-parameter to the predictor 
$$
\eta = f_1(t) + f_2(x) \, exp\left(\gamma_{0i} + f_3(z)\right) + f_4(lon,\, lat)
$$
and the link function is identity. We add noise that is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation equal to $\eta / 2$. $f_1(t)=cos(2\pi(t-1)/100)$ with $t$ being a sequence from 1 through 100. $f_2(x) = sin(x)$, where $x$ is uniformly distributed on $[\pi /2, \, 3\pi /2]$. $f_3(z)=0.7 \, cos(2\pi(z-1)/100)$, where $z$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[1,\, 100]$. $\gamma_{0i}$ is a normally distributed cluster-specific random effect for 3-digit postcode regions in Bavaria, Germany, with mean $0$ and standard deviation $0.49$. Finally, $f_4(lon,\, lat)=sin(2lon+lat)$, where $lon$ and $lat$ correspond to the longitude and latitude coordinates of the centroids of the 3-digit postcode regions.

## 250 repititions

Using the data generating process described above, we simulate 250 sets and run a model on each set. Below, you find the resulting effects as GIFs for each of the 250 models.
