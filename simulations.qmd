This page contains accompanying online materials to the paper. The files and data needed for the (single repetition) simulation can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgranna/jgranna.github.io/main/posts/data/online_material.zip).

## Data Generating Process

We carry out a simulation study for a Gaussian distribution, where we link the $\mu$-parameter to the predictor 
$$
\eta = f_1(t) + f_2(x) \, \cdot exp\left(\gamma_{0i} + f_3(z)\right) + f_4(lon,\, lat)
$$
and a standard deviation $\sigma^2$ such that the signal to noise ratio $\sigma_{\eta}/\sigma$ is 2. For the nonlinear functions we assume

-   $f_1(t)=cos(2\pi(t-1)/100)$ with $t$ being a sequence from 1 through 100,
-   $f_2(x) = sin(x)$, where $x$ is uniformly distributed on $[\pi /2, \, 3\pi /2]$,
-   $f_3(z)=0.7 \, cos(2\pi(z-1)/100)$ where $z$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[1,\, 100]$,
-   $f_4(lon,\, lat)=sin(2lon+lat)$, where $lon$ and $lat$ correspond to the longitude and latitude coordinates of the

centroids of the 3-digit postcode regions.

## 250 repititions

Using the data generating process described above, we simulate 250 sets and run a model on each set. Below, you find the resulting effects as GIFs for each of the 250 models.
